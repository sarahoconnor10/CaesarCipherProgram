Caesar Cipher Guessing Game - Group project - 1st year Essential Mathematics for Computing
Written by Sarah O'Connor, Rebecca Nolan, Louise Deeth, and Ty O'Brien

The purpose of this game is to explore Caesar Ciphers, either through a guessing game, or allowing the user to choose their own encryption.

The player can intially choose if they would like to play the Guessing Game, or choose the shift of their cipher.

If the player chooses to play the game, they are then prompted to choose their difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard. This choice determines the number of guesses allowed.
The game then asks the user their name, before encrypting the input using a secret, randomly chosen shift with a value between 1 and 9.
The user is given the cipher and has a set number of turns to guess the shift. 
Once the player has won or lost, they are prompted to either play again, or quit the program.

If the player chooses to input their own shift, they are prompted to enter their name, and a shift valued between 1 and 9. The program then outputs the result.
The user is then asked if they would like to play again, or quit the program.
